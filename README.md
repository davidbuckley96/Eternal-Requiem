# Eternal Requiem
 Choose-your-own-adventure game made by me with python's pygame library

Hello, everyone!
Eternal Requiem is a videogame project I made for personal use only and won't be distributed or sold in any way.
It is a choose-your-own-adventure vampire-themed horror game and might be inappropriate for some people because of some game text descriptions.
The only supported language is portuguese. Future versions might have an english version option on the main menu.
This project was only possible due to several generative AI:
    * Adobe Firefly for image genaration;
    * Stable Diffusion for image generation;
    * AIVA for music generation;
    * OPENAI GPT-4 for text generation;
The game was coded in Python with the PyGame framework and converted to .exe with PyInstaller.
Feel free to analyze the code and be inspired by it, but I do not give permission to replicate it for distribution of any kind.
